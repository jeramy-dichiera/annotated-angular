# annotated-angular
A simple Angular setup with comments for learning. This is being done without the angular CLI.

Check out the [official Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/understanding-angular-overview)

Use this project to trace through a simple angular app.

All of these files will be generated automatically when using the Angular CLI and there are some you can ignore for now.

Start with src/index.html and trace through.
